                    <span class="M">M</span>ahmood Yakubu was born in Bauchi State, Northern Nigeria. He completed his basic and secondary school education at Kobi Primary School and Government Teachers College, Toro, respectively. He proceeded to the University of Sokoto (now Usmanu Danfodiyo University), where he became the first and, to date, only Nigerian from the North to obtain a first-class degree certificate in history. At postgraduate level, he studied international relations at Wolfson College, Cambridge, graduating with master's degree in 1987, and Nigerian history at the University of Oxford, graduating with a doctorate in 1991. The Bauchi State Government offered him a scholarship to study at both the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. He went on to become a three-time recipient of the Overseas Research Scholarship, and also won the Commonwealth Scholarship from the Association of Commonwealth Universities. <br>
                    Yakubu is a lecturer, guerrilla warfare expert, and Professor of Political History and International Studies at the Nigerian Defence Academy. Prior to his appointment as Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood served as the executive secretary of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, being appointed to office in 2007 by then-President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua. During his tenure as secretary, a National Book Development Fund was established, supporting 102 journals of professional associations.
    
                    Yakubu also served as Assistant Secretary of Finance and Administration at the 2014 National Conference. In 2013, he was awarded an honorary fellowship to the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations.
    
                    On 7 January 2019, he released a new voting system for the 2019 general election with the introduction of the card reader which helped to minimize electoral fraud. In 2023 through the amended electoral act, he introduced the BVAS which helped to stop the issue of over voting and electoral result padding which have been the bane of Nigeria electoral system.

                    I am pleased to introduce the Commission's online portal for the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR).
    
                    Since the resumption of voter registration on a continuous basis in 2017, the Commission has been looking at ways to make voter registration easier, more accessible, and user-friendly not only to the multitude of prospective registrants, but also to registered voters who may wish to transfer their registration or have had their Permanent Voters' Cards (PVCs) missing or defaced. This is one of the Commission's innovations to enhance voter experience by making the registration exercise faster, easier, and less crowded than before. Given the lingering COVID-19 situation, the new registration solution will help decongest registration centers, reduce delays, and allow prospective registrants to schedule appointments and monitor their applications from the comfort of their homes.
    
                    The portal allows a two-step registration process in which first, prospective registrants login to pre-register by providing their basic biodata and some biometrics and second to   complete the registration by physically presenting themselves at a designated registration center of their choice.
    
                    This considerably eases the process as a substantial part of the exercise would have been completed online before physical contact with registration officials. I urge all eligible Nigerians to take advantage of the services offered by the Commission through this portal.
